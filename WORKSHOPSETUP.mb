# Workshop Setup
With these instructions you can set up a Codex node on your machine, to use during the Brussels 2024 workshop. If you run into trouble and need help, ask a nearby Codexer!

## Local network
Switch to the workshop wifi:
- SSID: `codex`
- Password: `ethcc2024`

## Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/codex-storage/codex-testnet-starter.git
```

Open a terminal in the scripts folder for your platform:
- `scripts/linux`
- `scripts/mac`
- `scripts/windows`

## Download Codex
Run `download` script.

## Generate an Eth key-pair
Run `generate` script.

Keep your public key at hand. Update the file named `eth.key` with your private key. You may need to change the permissions for this file. See the README.md in your platform specific folder.

## Start Codex node
Determine your local IP address. Use `ifconfig` or `ipconfig`, depending on your platform.

Set local IP environment variable
 - Bash: `export LOCALIP="192.168.179.999"`
 - Batch: `set LOCALIP="192.168.179.999"`

Run `run_client` script.

## Acquire tokens
You can acquire tokens in one of two ways: Discord bot or faucet.

### Discord bot
 - Join the Codex discord server: https://discord.gg/codex-storage.
 - Go to the "bot" channel, in the category "codex-bot".
 - Use `/set` command to enter your public key.
 - Use `/mint` command to receive some tokens.

### Faucet
 - Follow instructions on https://faucet-eth.testnet.codex.storage to get some Eth.
 - Follow instructions on https://faucet-tst.testnet.codex.storage to get some test tokens.
You will need both Eth and test tokens to use Codex.

## Use Codex
You can now proceed to use your Codex node. Follow the instructions [here](./USINGCODEX.md)
